## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### What CAN be recreated from frontend:
- ‚úÖ Complete UI layouts and component structures
- ‚úÖ Form handling and validation (basic)
- ‚úÖ State management patterns
- ‚úÖ Navigation and routing
- ‚úÖ Data display formatting
- ‚úÖ Filter and search functionality (frontend only)
- ‚úÖ Modal dialogs and user interactions
- ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations structure

### What NEEDS backend specification:
- ‚ùå Complex business logic
- ‚ùå External API integrations
- ‚ùå Payment processing workflows
- ‚ùå Email/notification systems
- ‚ùå File processing and validation
- ‚ùå Advanced reporting and analytics
- ‚ùå Automated workflows and triggers
